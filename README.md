This repository contains the proposed solutions to the programming exercises of the course "Symmetric Cryptography" held at TU Wien.

I had a lot of fun while preparing these exercises, and I wanted to give solutions in different programming languages (C, C++, Python, Rust).
However, mainly for time reasons (and for constantly having to fight with Rust's compiler) I soon fully switched to just C++.

### Note for students ###

not all exercises have been solved here, and the repository structure does not follow the order of the exercises, hence you will have to do a bit of guess-work when navigating around.
I'm planning to fix this for next iterations of the course.
You can find more of my own cryptographic implementations here: https://bitbucket.org/stefanotrevi/libcrypto

There are many great cryptography repos on GitHub and friends: for example, OpenSSL might be a bit overwhelming, but has basically everything.

If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me an email or open an issue here!
